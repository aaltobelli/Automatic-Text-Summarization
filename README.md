# Automatic Text Summarization - Extractive Techniques
The main goal of Automatic Text Summarization is the production of summaries from documents. Summaries are excerpts of the original text that
preserve key information content and overall meaning.

The goal of the following work is to analyze and implement different techniques of **Extractive Text Summarization**, and then compare their results. The main tasks of an Extractive Summarization process are:
1. Construction of an intermediate representation of the input text;
2. Scoring of the sentences based on such representation;
3. Selection of a summary comprising of a number of sentences (e.g. sentences with the highest score).

Methods that adopt TF-IDF representations and Machine Learning techniques were implemented. Furthermore, the work was contextualized in a typical Information Retrieval System, more specifically an Apache Solr server.
